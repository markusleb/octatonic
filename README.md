# octatonic
Python scripts to find all octatonic scales and their generator chords

Idea is as follows (inspired by Barry Harris' diminished 6th scale):
- construct all possible scales within the 12-tone chromatic realm
- as each of these scales can be represented by two 4-tone chords overlayed, identify all of the "generator" chords
- describe the set of generator chords in notation form

In addition: derive chord symbols manually

Future work: 
- create big table of scales and generators
